# "PROGRAMMING WITH PYTHON FOR DATA-SCIENCE" offered by Microsoft on Edx

Hello , this repository contains my exercise work, The series of code is what I have completed and implemented while attending the course. this may help freshers at some points ...i have provided some alternative codes thru comments in the 
exercise code. I have completed these exercises by oct. 2017

I came across this amazing hidden-gem data-science course  by Microsoft on Edx  during  my college in  2017  and decided to give it a try. Having extensively used libraries in all my ML projects this course gave me a much clearer understanding of the ground level mechanics of the Math behind these great ML techniques using "SkLearn". The intuitive approach in covering few complicated concepts just make it look so interesting and relatively easy.

This course introduces basic steps right from
data-exploring ,data-cleaning ,data-visualization ,data-transforming to data-modelling 
by using tools such as >>NUMPY, PANDAS ,MATPLOTLIB and SkLearn for data-modelling 


certificate of the completed course will be uploaded to my Linkedin ac. after purchasing.


## Code Requirements
The example code is in python (Libraries used pandas,numpy,Matplotlib, SkLearn)
